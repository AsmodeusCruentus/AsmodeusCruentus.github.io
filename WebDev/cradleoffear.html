        <br><h2>Cradle of Fear is a British horror film, Directed by Alex Chandon. 
        <br>Alex Changdon took great inspiration from the Anthology films that were
        <br>produced by Amicus Productions around the 70s.
        <br>The Amicus Production produced films like <br>"From beyond the grave"<br>"Tales from the Crypt"<br>"Asylum"
        <br>The Films runtime is around 120 minutes and consists of three 30 minute stories
        <br>that are then tied together by a fourth overall story.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> The plot of the movie focuses around an serial killer named Kemper.
        <br> After being improsed in an insane asylum he starts causing mayhem for those at fault for his imprisonment.
        <br> Kemper was the son of an infamous satanist and used hypnosis to carry out his crimes.
        <br> The main character is "The Man" who is protrayed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Filth" style="text-decoration:none; color:inherit;">Dani Filth</a> who finds the perputrators of Kempers capture
        <br> and finds ways for them to get into accidents and die, all of which sparks the interested of Inspector Peter Neilson.
        <br> All these events remind Neilson of a serial killer he has imprisoned years ago.
        <br> 
        <br>
        <br> The film didn't really catch the greatest of attention from the Horror fanatics or the Horror press due to its low budget filming,
        <br> It has however maintained viewership from fans of the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_Filth" style="text-decoration:none; color:inherit;">"Cradle of Filth"</a> Since the bands frontman
        <br> Dani Filth portayes "The Man", even though the entire band appears in cameos in the movie. 
        <br> This has caused fans of the band to watch the movie and even cosplay "The Man".
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> Alex Chandons partnership with the band started when he recorded their promo video for the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnbOhSGVbRg" style="text-decoration:none; color:inherit;">"From the Cradle to Enslave"</a>
        <br> He later went on to assist in recording portions of other videos such as "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRNfeMaUBbo" style="text-decoration: none;color: inherit;">Her Ghost in the Fog"</a> & "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_Bf05_IJxA" style="text-decoration: none;color: inherit;">"No Time to Cry</a>
