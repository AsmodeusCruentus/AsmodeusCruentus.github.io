        <h5>Call of Cthulhu</h5>
        <br>
        <h1>Call of Cthulhu</h1>
    
    <p>
        The story consists of three interconnected parts, and is presented as notes belonging to Francis Thurston, 
        a Boston resident investigating the ancient deity Cthulhu.
        The first part, "The Horror in Clay", concerns a mysterious clay bas-relief depicting Cthulhu. Thurston 
        finds the bas-relief among the belongings of his great-uncle Professor Angell. The bas-relief was created 
        by sculptor Henry Wilcox in March 1925 while half-asleep. At the time Wilcox was haunted by mysterious 
        visions of Cyclopean cities. Angell also discovered reports of local residents — primarily artists,
        sculptors, architects, and others of a sensitive psyche — experiencing similar nightmares during that 
        period. The next morning, Wilcox was amazed by his creation and took it to Angell, who noted that the
        bas-relief was reminiscent of a figurine seized by police from members of a New Orleans religious sect 
        in 1907.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the second chapter, "The Tale of Inspector Legrasse", police officer John Legrasse reports at an 
        archaeological society's symposium on his participation in a raid of a sect worshipping Cthulhu, from 
        which the figurine was confiscated. The sect's actions were described as depraved and blasphemous. 
        Local residents feared the sect's orgies, and claimed that human sacrifices were made at these orgies. 
        A team of officers led by Legrasse arrived at the scene in search of several missing squatters. 
        The police detained several sect members, but interrogation yielded little result, as the degraded 
        and insane members stubbornly defended the truth of their cult. One sectarian, Old Castro, proclaimed 
        that Cthulhu's time would come when the stars take a certain position. A phrase chanted by the sect
         turns out to have been previously used by a tribe of Eskimos, as revealed by one of the symposium's 
         participants.
    </p>    
    <p>
        In the third chapter, "The Madness from the Sea", Thurston continues his investigation. He learns of 
        the Norwegian sailor Gustaf Johansen, the sole survivor of his crew, and finds manuscripts documenting
         his last voyage as second mate on board the schooner Emma. During a storm, Emma veered off course and 
         encountered the pirate yacht Alert. Although the crew was victorious against the pirates, they were
         forced to abandon the damaged Emma and transfer to the Alert. Johansen took command following the 
         skirmish, as the captain and first mate had perished. On the Alert, the sailors discovered a figurine 
         of Cthulhu, which horrified and disgusted them. The sailors continued their course and landed on the 
         uncharted island-city of R'lyeh. Although they were terrified, they proceeded to explore out of curiosity. The geometry of the island was unfamiliar, and it was not even possible to tell exactly whether the land and sea were horizontal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sailors approached a huge door, which began to appear not quite vertical. When they accidentally 
        opened it, Cthulhu emerged, awakening from a dream. Two of the eight sailors died on the spot from fright.
         Cthulhu swept up three more with its paw. As the other three fled, one of them hit the corner of a 
         building and seemed to be sucked in. The remaining two managed to reach the yacht, but one of the sailors
         lost his mind from the horror he experienced and died a few days later. The only one who escaped with his
         life and mind, Johansen, started the yacht, but realized there was insufficient time to pick up speed.
         Johansen turned the yacht around and rammed Cthulhu. By the time Cthulhu began to recover, the yacht had
         already sailed to a safe distance. A few days later, R'lyeh submerged back into the ocean, and the 
         nightmares that had plagued humanity ceased.
    </p>
    <p>    
        Thurston, after learning that Johansen died under unknown circumstances, speculates that Angell died at 
        the hands of Cthulhu's cult. He then fears that he has become the cult's new target, as he has learned 
        too much, and he attempts to keep his mind off Cthulhu's next coming.
