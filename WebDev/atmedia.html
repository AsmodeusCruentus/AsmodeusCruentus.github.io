        <main class="main1"><h1>Plot</h1>In 2047, a distress signal is received from the Event Horizon, <br>
            a starship that disappeared during its maiden voyage to Proxima Centauri seven years earlier. <br>
            The ship mysteriously reappears in a decaying orbit around Neptune, and the rescue vessel <br>
            Lewis and Clark is dispatched to investigate. Its crew—Capt. Miller, <br>
            second-in-command Lt. Starck, pilot Smith, medical technician Peters, <br>
            engineer Ensign Justin, doctor D.J., and rescue technician Cooper—is joined by <br>
            Dr. William Weir, the Event Horizon's designer. He briefs them on the ship's <br>
            experimental gravity drive with a simple visualization of how it folds space-time.<br>
             The distress signal consists of a series of screams and howls but D.J. <br>
             believes he hears the Latin phrase "Liberate me" ("Save me").<br>
             <br>
            Upon boarding the Event Horizon the crew finds evidence of a massacre. <br>
            As they search for survivors, the ship's gravity drive activates and <br>
            briefly pulls Justin into a portal while also causing a shock wave that <br>
            damages the Lewis and Clark. The crew are all forced to board the Event Horizon<br>
             while Justin emerges in a catatonic state. He attempts suicide by decompression, <br>
             but is saved by Miller, forcing the crew to place Justin in stasis. Smith and <br>
             Cooper are sent on a spacewalk to repair the hull of the Lewis and Clark.<br>
             <br>
            The crew begins having hallucinations corresponding to their fears and regrets.<br> 
            Miller sees a subordinate he was forced to abandon to his death; Peters sees her <br>
            son with his legs covered in bloody lesions; Weir sees an eyeless vision of his <br>
            late wife urging him to join her. They discover a video log of the Event Horizon's<br>
             crew fornicating and mutilating each other shortly after first engaging the gravity <br>
             drive. The log ends with a shot of the Event Horizon's captain, holding his own eyes <br>
             gouged from their sockets and speaking the Latin phrase from the earlier distress <br>
             call. D.J. translates the complete phrase as "Liberate tutemet ex inferis" ("Save yourself from hell").<br>
             <br>
            Weir explains that the ship's drive opened a gateway to a hellish dimension<br>
             outside the known universe, and that the Event Horizon has attained sentience.<br>
             Miller decides to destroy it and orders an evacuation while Peters is lured to <br>
             her death by a hallucination of her son. Weir, who has gouged out his own eyes <br>
             and is possessed by the evil presence, destroys the Lewis and Clark and kills Smith.<br>
             Weir then kills D.J. by vivisecting him and corners Starck on the bridge. <br>
             Miller confronts Weir, who overpowers him and initiates a 10-minute countdown to<br>
             activate the gravity drive and return to the other dimension.<br>
             <br>
            Cooper uses his space suit's oxygen supply to propel himself back to the ship and <br>
            appears at the bridge window. Weir shoots at him, shattering the window, causing Weir <br>
            to be blown into space by the decompression. Miller, Starck, and Cooper survive and <br>
            manage to seal off the ship's bridge. With their own ship destroyed, Miller plans to <br>
            split the Event Horizon in two with explosives and use its forward section as a lifeboat.<br>
             He is attacked by hallucinations which turn out to be the resurrected and further mutilated Weir.<br>
             Miller fights him off and detonates the explosives, sacrificing himself.<br>
             <br>
            The gravity drive activates, pulling the ship's stern section into a black hole.<br> 
            Starck and Cooper enter stasis beside a comatose Justin and wait to be rescued. <br>
            Seventy-two days later, the wreckage of the Event Horizon is boarded by a rescue party<br> 
            who discover the survivors in stasis. Starck sees Weir posing as one of the rescuers and <br>
            screams in terror, but wakes up and realizes that it was a nightmare. Cooper and the rescue<br>
             team try to calm the terrified Starck as the doors close.

        <aside class="aside2"><h2>aside 2</h2>Filming took place in Pinewood Studios. Anderson modeled the Event Horizon ship after Notre Dame Cathedral using an architectural cam program. <br>
            Effects supervisors Richard Yuricich and Neil Corbould kept most visuals in-camera, and moving sets were constructed for the gyrosphere gravity <br>
            drive and the revolving tunnel. For scenes depicting zero gravity, the actors were hung upside down in harnesses and spun around. <br>
            The original script had more zero gravity scenes, but budget constraints had the filmmakers introduce magnetic boots. <br>
            Because the majority of scenes were filmed in a studio on gothic-inspired sets, Anderson felt the cast experienced <br>
            a kind of "cabin fever" that better served their performances<br>
